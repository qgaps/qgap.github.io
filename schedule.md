    <td>  Ø434 Physics Department </td>
    <td> Oskar Leinonen, Jonas Boym Flaten, Stian Dysthe Bilek, Øyvind Sigmundson Schøyen </td>
    <td> Talk about their current paper, generation and evolution of entanglement in quantum many-body systems. Theoretically investigate the generation of motional entanglement between two electrons via their unscreened Coulomb interaction. <a href="https://qgaps.github.io/2023-09-22-quantum-consulting/">More Here</a> </td>

    <td> Keran Victoria Chen </td>
    <td> Recent advances on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), perhaps the most popular algorithm for solving quantum mechanical problems on present days quantum computers. <a href="https://qgaps.github.io/2023-10-02-ADAPT-VQE">More Here</a> </td>

    <td>  CCSE, FØ457 </td>
    <td> Håkon Kvernmoen </td>
    <td>  Short introduction to coupled-cluster theory, introducing the exponential ansatz and discussing different truncation levels. Ground state calculations will be covered, regarding both energy and additions to handle other observables. <a href="https://qgaps.github.io/2023-10-06-coupled-cluster">More Here</a> </td>
