    <td> Oskar Leinonen, Jonas Boym Flaten, Stian Dysthe Bilek, Øyvind Sigmundson Schøyen </td>
    <td> Talk about their current paper, generation and evolution of entanglement in quantum many-body systems. Theoretically investigate the generation of motional entanglement between two electrons via their unscreened Coulomb interaction. <a href="https://qgaps.github.io/2023-09-22-quantum-consulting/">More Here</a> </td>
