**Current abstract**

The generation and evolution of entanglement in quantum many-body systems is an active area of
research that spans multiple fields, from quantum information science to the simulation of quantum
many-body systems encountered in condensed matter, subatomic physics, and quantum chemistry.
Motivated by recent experiments exploring quantum information processing systems with electrons
trapped above the surface of cryogenic noble gas substrates, we theoretically investigate the gen-
eration of motional entanglement between two electrons via their unscreened Coulomb interaction.
The model system consists of two electrons confined in separate electrostatic traps which establish
microwave frequency quantized states of their motion. We compute the motional energy spectra of
the electrons, as well as their entanglement, by diagonalizing the model Hamiltonian with respect
to a single-particle Hartree product basis. This computational procedure can in turn be employed
for device design and guidance of experimental implementations. In particular, the theoretical
tools developed here can be used for fine tuning and optimization of control parameters in future
experiments with electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium or solid neon.
