We will touch upon (the prerequisits for) qubit simulations and also modelling of optical lineshape via neural network potentials. The qubit stuff is more of work in progress with lots of open questions that we think  would be interested in discussing and not so much results. The other part with optical lineshapes is almost a finished project but it would be quite nice to share the results since it is in the very frontline of what one can do with computer simulations in materials physics.
