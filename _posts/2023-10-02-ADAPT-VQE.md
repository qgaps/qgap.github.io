Keran will talk about recent advances on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), perhaps the most popular algorithm for solving quantum mechanical problems on present days quantum computers. She plans to  focus on results from [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10988-2) paper: Note also that from this Monday and on we are back to our meeting room at the CCSE, FÃ˜457, fourth floor department of physics.
