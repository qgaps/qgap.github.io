# qGAP seminar series

The series of seminars/lectures are meant to cover broadly activities
at UiO related to quantum technologies, developments in many-body
theories related or unrelated to quantum technologies, machine
learning applied to quantum mechanical systems and quantum machine
learning. We aim at having regular seminars, discussions of recent
articles, presentations by master and PhD students and more. We aim
also at discussing experimental work and theoretical work, with
obviously a strong link to condensed matter physics, materials science
and semi-conductor physics, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies.
Educational topics can also be included. 


## Our meetings are on Mondays (start 2024: January 22),
at **3:15pm** at the Center for Computing Science Education, Physics
bulding, seminar room **Ø465** (Physics building, eastern wing).

Also available via  [zoom](https://msu.zoom.us/j/92966123227?pwd=ME02YmE5UGVCZGhCNWJPZG1zcExQZz09)
Meeting ID: 929 6612 3227

### Title: Parameterized Optimization of Quantum Circuits (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08514)
Abstract: Quantum variational circuit compiling is a technique in quantum computing where quantum circuits are
transformed into more efficient forms, known as parameterized ansatzes, through a combination of quantum and classical computational methods.
This talk explains a new approach within this domain, called the recursive variational quantum compiling algorithm (RVQC). Unlike standard
variational quantum compiling (VQC) algorithms, which require running the entire target circuit for compilation, RVQC breaks down the target circuit
into  segments. Each segment is individually and recursively compressed into the parameterized ansatz. This method advantage lies
in its ability to compress circuits without being dependent on the entire target circuit depth.

## February 19:  Morten Hjorth-Jensen (Physics, UiO)
### Title: Parametric Matrix Models and Machine Learning (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11694)
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. Parametric matrix
models are based on matrix equations, and the design is motivated by the efficiency of reduced basis methods
for approximating solutions of parametric equations. Parametric matrix models can be trained with empirical data only,
and no high-fidelity model calculations are needed. Parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied
to general machine learning problems.

## February 26:  Joakim Bergli (Physics, UiO)
### Title: Introduction to quantum error correction
Abstract: I will explain breifly the simplest classical error correction codes and the difficulties of constructing
quantum error correction codes based on the same ideas. Then I will show how one can by small modifications get quantum
error correction codes and show how they work. The focus is on understanding the basic principles by simple
examples (the three qubit repetition code and the 9-qubit Shor code) rather than descibing the general framework or the optimal codes.

## March 4:      Joakim Bergli (Physics, UiO) 
### Title: Synchronization in two-level quantum systems
Abstract: Synchronization is a process where an oscillating system synchronizes its frequency and phase to an external
signal (or one or more additional oscillating system). The classical theory of syncronization is well developed, and there is
now interest in transferring this to quantum systems, understanding in what way they are similar or different from classical systems.
I will explain how one can use these concepts in describing a two-level system interacting with a thermal environment
and how we can apply the quantum trajectory theory to get more detailed information. 

## March 5:      Antoine Camper (Physics, UiO)
### Title: Seminar on Quantum Detectors for high energy physics by Michael Doser (CERN) on the 5th of March
at 14:00 (location: Auditorium 1 in Helga Engs hus). This seminar will be opened to everyone and announced broadly.
The seminar will be followed by a Workshop  starting at 15h30 with two 15 minutes talk given by Morten
Hjorth-Jensen and Lasse Vines and a one hour round table discussion with Michael Doser (Fysikkbygningen Seminarrom Ø397).
The workshop is intended to gather everyone interested in the Quantum Technology initiative and

### Title: Gaussian processes for continual learning
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) can be used as a principled Bayesian approach to regression problems. But many practical
applications of GPs are hampered by the fact that the training time for a naive GP implementation scales as the number of data
points cubed. In this talk I will give an introduction to Gaussian processes and present a method that enables "continual learning"
with GPs, i.e. a GP regression model that continually adapts to a never-ending data stream. if time, I will discuss example
applications of this method for computationally expensive parameter estimation studies.
