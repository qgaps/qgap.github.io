**Digital Simulations of the Z2 Lattice Gauge Theory using Superconductive IBM Devices**

In this presentation Ruben is going to discuss different quantum simulations of the simplest lattice gauge theory, the Z2 model, performed on a superconductive device. The main focus is on investigating the dynamics and ground state properties through Real-Time Evolution and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) approaches to better understand the capabilities of this new IBM quantum devices for quantum simulations. Additionally, Ruben will discuss different error mitigation techniques to enhance result accuracy.
