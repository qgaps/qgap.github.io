Today, coupled-cluster theory offers one of the most accurate results among the practical ab initio electronic-structure theories applicable to moderate-sized molecules, in addition to having applications in nuclear physics.

HÃ¥kon will give a short introduction to coupled-cluster theory, introducing the exponential ansatz and discussing different truncation levels. Ground state calculations will be covered, regarding both energy and additions to handle other observables.
