subtitle: Who we are and where to find us.

We are a group of students (Master's and PhD's) working on computational physics applied to quantum mechanics. 
Our research interests range from many-body physics, quantum computing, machine learning, and quantum machine learning with applications to a broad range of systems.

### Where do we spend our days (and some nights)
